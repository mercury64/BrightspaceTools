*** DEPRECATED ***

No need to use anylonger.

We just received good news that the WCLN Moodle Content packages can now be imported into D2L Brightspace without any modifications.

Here is the quote from D2L's integration specialist:
"In Brightspaceâ€™s June 2021 release, we added support for passing custom_id from Moodle packages. Therefore, scripted or manual workarounds for importing WCLN courses are no longer required.
 
Thanks to this release, in our testing we found that once the tool provider information is set up, any imported courses will work perfectly for both types of launches that WCLN courses contain (pages and books), using a single tool provider and launch point."
